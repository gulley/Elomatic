# Elomatic

Create a single page HTML/JavaScript app for ranking items using Elo-style comparisons.
Use local storage.
The main page will show all items in a list, ordered from high to low by their Elo score.
Each item contains a title (required) and a URL (optional). The app will assign and manage an Elo score associated with each item.
From the main page there are two major options. One is Edit. This puts all items into a single edit box so they can be edited. From the Edit page, you can save the list or cancel to get back to the main page.
The other option is Rank. This will pull two distinct items at random from the list and put them on a comparison page. The use will select one option or the other. Based on this vote, the Elo scores for each item will be updated and another Ranking pair will be displayed. 
From the Rank page, you can return to the main page.
